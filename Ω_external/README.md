The `external` directory is for organizing information and content that is created or managed by someone else. 


> [!question] Why a separate directory for "external" content?
> "External content is just that:Â _external_. Someone else created it and likely maintains it. It could change. As such, we should identify and organize external content in our vaults. This will make it easier to update or replace in the future when the creator makes changes."[^1]


# Examples of External Data

- 5E Systems Reference Document
- Stat blocks made by other creators
- Monster compendiums created by someone else
